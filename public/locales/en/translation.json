    "title": "🌿 Benefits of Religious Knowledge",
    "description": "Seeking sacred knowledge is a path to light and guidance. It gives the heart insight into truth, comforts the soul with divine mercy, and raises the spirit above doubts and desires. It is worship that draws one closer to Allah, a shield against ignorance and trials, and a trust to spread good. Blessed is the one who dedicates time to memorizing the Qur’an, understanding the Sunnah, and walking the scholars’ path—for the angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge, and all creation seeks forgiveness for them.",
